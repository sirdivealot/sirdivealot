                <p>In 2019 the team assembled again and set sail towards Ambon, a relatively large island belonging to the <span class="module__title__link">Maluku Islands (Moluccas)</span>. Technically they are a part of Indonesia but history tells a different story.</p>
<p>We managed to get cheap tickets (~700 EUR pp.) from Copenhagen to Ambon and back again, with stopovers in Istanbul and Jakarta. Almost 20 hours after departure from Sweden we took a quick nap at our usual resting place (Digital Airport Hotel, a decent place for a few ours of sleep) before embarking on the last leg towards Ambon.</p>
<p>Upon arrival we, a tired and sorry bunch, hailed a taksi and went to find our homestay - Crecia. A clean and well-managed enterprise, located barely 5 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from Critterjunkies (and the Laha area). The folks from Crecia had no idea we were arriving but armed with pre-negotiated deals and emails we quickly got an accord and could be on our merry way to Critterjunkies.</p>
<p>Less than 18 hours later we had done our first dive and enjoyed some rest.</p>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://sirdivealot.com/media/posts/10/IMG_8887.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="478"></p>
<p>Almost as if struck by lightning, Kristoffer got a severe fever and had to be isolated at Crecia. After a full day of diving, we found him were we left him 9 hours earlier, shaken and despirited ü§í. A few days later we could hear him mumble about "missing out. trip almost over. doctor." and found out he had planned with Crecia to find a local doctor. The next day he felt better and due to some strong urgings from the diveshop peeps, he turned down his appointment and went diving instead.</p>
<p>The next one to be culled was me (Axel), but I managed to get better after 2 days off and never got the hallucinations which left Kristoffer in his near-soulless state. On the other hand my bed was on the floor. Due to earlier trips, and an adamant Caroline, it was apparently my turn to have the bad bed and so I slept right underneath the air conditioning unit ‚ùÑÔ∏è.¬†</p>
<p>You might be forgiven if you assumed that Caroline was next in line, but no - after sacrificing a cat during a full moon she was spared the Ambon Fever and never had to skip diving. However, she did get a chock on her first dive that left her skeptic of Ambon's greatness - the critters lived in garbage. Plastic was floating on the surface and metal cans made homes for all kinds of underwater life. This chock held her in its grip for the majority of the trip but we hope she came out stronger because of it üòâ.</p>
<p>Diving-wise, Ambon (and Critterjunkies!) delivered amazing dives. We had spent the long months after last dive trip researching, preparing and made a "Ambon Most Wanted". A week of diving later (excluding the fever) only a few critters had eluded our eagle-eyed spotters. Diving with Critterjunkies was a bit different as our guides mostly worked as spotters, there was really no guiding to be done, no predetermined route to take. Sandy, muddy slopes everywhere and not much coral to speak of. This suited us perfectly.</p>

<p>Hello, this is Kristof reporting in from Tulamben, Bali. I make bubbles no troubles and take only pictures.</p>

<p class="dropcap">This trip actually started in Pulau Weh, Sumatra, but after a couple of weeks we needed more macro, so we contacted the wonderful Aqua Dive Paradise over on Tulamben and after a few days we took the flight to Bali.</p>
<p>We did all diving with ADP.¬†</p>

                <p class="dropcap">This trip to Mabul was very good and we are very likely coming back to the beautiful island of Pulau Mabul. We stayed and did all our diving with Mabul Backpackers - very affordable, decent food and good guides!</p>
<p class="align-center"><iframe width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2ugkHw2p2k" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" ></iframe></p>
<p>Most of our diving was done around Pulau Mabul, with some day-trips to Kapalai, and of course Sipadan. During our 3-week stay we booked 5 days of Sipadan diving. It was awesome and we are still very excited about all the footage and photographs we managed to capture.¬†</p>
